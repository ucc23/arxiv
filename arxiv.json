      "title": "Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters\n  in giant elliptical galaxies",
      "summary": "  It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist\nwith the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers -\nunavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars.\nHowever, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a\nthird of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs\nin giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could\nexplain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major\nmerger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a\ngravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two\ncompeting effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become\nbound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil\nvelocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls\nback due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.\nAt intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become\nimportant, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background\nstellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the\ngalaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have\nrealistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to\nobserved systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing\nSMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable\ncolors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low\nellipticities.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical model of Praesepe and its tidal tails",
      "summary": "  Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the\nMilky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on\nthe initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models\ntailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in\nthe Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of\nPraesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the\nmass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model,\nwe investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail.\nMethods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of\nPraesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents\none star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and\nthe initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based\non this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars\nin the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes.\nResults. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated\nstar formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion,\nadopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially\n7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass\nsegregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the\nself-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular\nmomentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping\nis about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc,\nwhere tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift\nof the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect\nis not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.\n",

      "title": "Characterizing the star cluster populations in Stephan's Quintet using\n  HST and JWST observations",
      "summary": "  Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a local compact galaxy group system that exhibits\nsignificant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between\nits four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and\nthe original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in\nmany shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster\ncandidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate\nflux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W,\nF356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended\nphotometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning ~300 nm to ~3500 nm, we\nperform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to\nderive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588\nhigh-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs (~a few\nMyr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near\nthe merging galaxies, while older (>100 Myr) and globular clusters are more\nwidely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the\nage-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger,\nmoderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also\nobserve a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced\nmolecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions\nwith no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation,\naround 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ\nthat gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.\n",

      "summary": "  The formation of the Universe's first luminous stellar structures depends on\nthe unique conditions at \"Cosmic Dawn,\" which are set by the underlying\ncosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that\nhigh-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\\odot$\npc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of\nstellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We\ninvestigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which\nexplore the capacity for $\\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density\nsystems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark\nmatter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution\nin early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities\neven in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We\nanalyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of\nstructure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the\nbrightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of\nindividual $z\\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\\odot$ is challenging,\nalthough lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially\nif a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters\nseparately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of\nthe high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass\nclusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a\npromising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.\n",

      "title": "First direct detection of an RR Lyrae star conclusively associated with\n  an intermediate-age cluster",
      "summary": "  RR Lyrae stars have long been considered unequivocal tracers of old (>10 Gyr)\nand metal-poor ($\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-0.5$) stellar populations. First, because\nthese populations are where they are readily found and because, according to\ncanonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only\npopulations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however,\nare challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR\nLyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct\nevidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these\nstars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and\nrobust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically\nassociated member stars from the Hunt & Reffert database by crossmatching\nagainst a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys\n(\\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV).\n  We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of\nthe 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions\nand their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low\nprobability ($0.049\\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae\nand provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its\nposition in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of\ndebate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of\nthe existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally\nexpected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.\n",

A\ntaxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs (\"blue stragglers\"), giants\n(\"yellow stragglers\"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars (\"sub-subgiants\"\nand \"red stragglers\"). This literature review is organized according to this\ntaxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star\nclusters, and the Galactic field.\n  This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and\nFriends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu &\nPols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi:\nwww.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-071221-054402). It\nis intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual\nReview of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the\ncommon and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution\nproducts is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key\nobservational results are referenced in this literature review.\n  The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations\nsubsequently updated.\n",

      "summary": "  Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC)\nsupergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star\nformation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies\nhave reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the\nchemical evolution of this unique region.\n  Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant\nGCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance\nanalyses.\n  Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed\nusing contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from\nscandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to\naccurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium.\n  Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06\n$\\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower\nthan previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance\nby approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with\nrecent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling.\n  Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22\nsuggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type\nII supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings\nsupport a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent\nbursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas\ninflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future\ncomprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for\nrefining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star\nformation history.\n",

      "title": "The evolution of velocity dispersion in the Sco-Cen OB association",
      "summary": "  We study how stellar velocity dispersion within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB\nassociation (Sco-Cen) has evolved over approximately 20 million years, from its\nformation to the present day. Using data from the \\textit{Gaia} mission along\nwith supplementary stellar radial velocities, we identified a surprising\nsequence of abrupt jumps and intervening plateaus in the velocity dispersion\ncorrelating with star formation bursts. These changes in velocity dispersion\ncoincide with the association expanding in size. We measure a present-day\nexpansion rate of about 10--12\\,pc\\,Myr$^{-1}$ and observe that younger star\nclusters within the association exhibit higher velocities compared to older\nones. This result, along with the stepwise increase in both velocity dispersion\nand spatial extent over time, suggests a structured and sequential star\nformation process rather than a random one. This phased evolution strongly\nsuggests that stellar feedback is the primary driver of Sco-Cen's star\nformation history, expansion, and eventual dispersal. Our findings emphasize\nthe value of precisely characterizing stellar populations within OB\nassociations, particularly through the creation of detailed, high-resolution\nage maps.\n",

      "summary": "  The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disk provides\nkey constraints on models of galaxy evolution. However, studies using planetary\nnebulae (PNe) as tracers have been historically limited by large uncertainties\nin their distances. To overcome the long-standing distance uncertainties, we\nrecalibrated the H$\\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation (Frew et al.\n2016) with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, deriving statistical distances for 1,200 PNe\nand Bayesian distances for 419 objects with reliable parallaxes. Adopting\nBayesian values preferentially, we determined the O/H radial gradient for 230\ndisk PNe. We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit\nwith one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection\nis statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near\nthe solar radius ($R \\sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient\ninward and a steeper negative gradient outward. This feature may reflect\nchanges in star formation efficiency driven by the Galactic bar or the\ncorotation resonance of the spiral arms. Comparison with other tracers -\nCepheids, red giants, and open clusters - shows qualitative consistency. The\ntwo-dimensional O/H distribution in the Galactic plane supports the adopted\ndistances and reveals modest azimuthal asymmetry, with enhanced abundances near\nthe bar at positive longitudes, and a bimodal abundance structure between the\ninner and outer solar regions. Our results provide new constraints on the\nchemical evolution of the Milky Way, the impact of non-axisymmetric structures,\nand the possible existence of distinct radial abundance regimes across the\nGalactic disk.\n",

      "title": "Stellar Feedback Effects on the Mass Distribution of Clouds and Cloud\n  Complexes",
      "summary": "  Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their\nsurroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly\naffects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having\nstronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass\ndistribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback,\nparticularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We\ninvestigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since\nclusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback\ndependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields\nfewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff\ndensities of $10,\\ 10^{1.5},\\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf\ngalaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We\ncalculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe,\nstellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for\nclouds with $n>100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution\nfor complexes with $n>10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of\nradiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts\nour hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to\nfeedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence,\nsuggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass\nfunction must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and,\nin the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature. (shortened)\n",

      "title": "Dwarf Galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: Hubble Space Telescope Observations\n  of Nuclear Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  In dwarf galaxies, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are believed to primarily\nform from the migration and merger of globular clusters (GCs), with a possible\ncontribution from in-situ star-forming activity triggered by gas infall. We\npresent the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including\nultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using\nthe F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface\nbrightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies\nwith a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's\nhigh spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We\nmodeled the NSCs with a S\\'ersic profile and derived their structural\nproperties and photometry. We find the NSC S\\'ersic index to increase with the\nluminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective\nradius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile,\nwhereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive\nNSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including\nin-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more\nmassive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be\ndue to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive\nNSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More\nobservations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation\nscenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.\n",

      "title": "Evolution of Stellar Activity and Habitable zone: I. Ultraviolet\n  Emission of Dwarfs in Open Clusters and Field Stars",
      "summary": "  Near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation from dwarf stars plays a critical role in\nshaping the habitability of planetary systems, yet its long-term evolution\nacross different spectral types remains poorly investigated. Based on GALEX NUV\nobservations, we study the evolution of stellar NUV emission for a sample of\n386,500 A- to M-type dwarfs spanning ages from 3 Myr to 10 Gyr, drawn from both\nopen clusters and the field. The normalized NUV emission ($f_{\\rm NUV}/f_{\\rm\nJ}$) is used to trace the evolutionary trends. Our results reveal distinct\nevolutionary pathways after considering the distance completeness: A and\nearly-F dwarfs show a weak decline in NUV emission during the main-sequence\nphase; late-F to G dwarfs exhibit a clear decrease, consistent with continuous\nspin-down driven by magnetic braking; late-K and M-dwarfs undergo a rapid\ndecline in NUV emission when they evolve from young stellar objects to\nmain-sequence stars. Furthermore, we construct the evolutionary tracks of\nstellar ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ). By comparing stellar circumstellar\nhabitable zone (CHZ) and UHZ, we find that G- and K-type stars offer the most\nstable overlap between thermal and UV habitability over long-term evolution.\n",
