      "title": "From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth,\n  mergers, and tidal disruptions",
      "summary": "  Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are\nhypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole,\npossibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and\nlikely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear\nstar cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the\nsupermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black\nhole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our\nmodel. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under\nreasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption\nevents and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal\ndisruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture\nrate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we\ncomment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.\n",

      "title": "Limits on Stellar Flybys in the Solar Birth Cluster",
      "summary": "  The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly\nsensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar\nclusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the\nsource of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties\nof the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the\nouter solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations\nthe implications of the low inclinations ($i < 20^{\\circ}$) of the distant\nsednoids (objects with perihelia $q > 40 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a\n> 400 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find\nthat the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth\ncluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the\nSun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{\\;\nMyr \\; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^4\n\\mathrm{\\; Myr \\; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold\nclassical Kuiper belt.\n",

      "title": "Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host\n  Galaxies within 45 pc",
      "summary": "  Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution\nspectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies,\nwith the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The\nstellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals\na younger recent starburst ($\\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an\noffset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\\sim$550 Myr), a radial age\ngradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar\ndensity of $\\sim5900 \\pm 800 \\, M_\\odot / \\mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the\nnucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star\nclusters. High-ionization ``coronal\" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\\lambda 5677$,\n[Fe VII] $\\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\\lambda 6375$, are also detected within\nthe nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly\nalongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not\ndetect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence\nin the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at\nvarious radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion\nepisodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger\ndriving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in\npost-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star\nformation history on $<$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.\n",

      "title": "The selection function of the Gaia DR3 open cluster census",
      "summary": "  Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic\nstructure. The completeness of the Galactic open cluster census, however,\nremains poorly understood. For the first time ever, we establish the selection\nfunction of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an\nopen-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the\nHunt & Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced\nour cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection\nand retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt & Reffert\ncatalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that\ndepends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data\ndensity, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple\nmodel accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\\% accuracy on our\ntraining data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders\nof magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why\ncertain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster\ndetectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper\nmotion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital\nspeed can result in an almost 3$\\times$ higher detection probability, depending\non its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and\nretrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other\nscience cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using\nour results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open\ncluster census. Our work will enable a number of brand new types of study, such\nas detailed comparisons between the Milky Way's cluster census and recent\nextragalactic cluster samples.\n",
