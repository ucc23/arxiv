      "title": "Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host\n  Galaxies within 45 pc",
      "summary": "  Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution\nspectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies,\nwith the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The\nstellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals\na younger recent starburst ($\\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an\noffset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\\sim$550 Myr), a radial age\ngradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar\ndensity of $\\sim5900 \\pm 800 \\, M_\\odot / \\mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the\nnucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star\nclusters. High-ionization ``coronal\" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\\lambda 5677$,\n[Fe VII] $\\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\\lambda 6375$, are also detected within\nthe nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly\nalongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not\ndetect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence\nin the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at\nvarious radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion\nepisodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger\ndriving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in\npost-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star\nformation history on $<$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.\n",

      "title": "The selection function of the Gaia DR3 open cluster census",
      "summary": "  Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic\nstructure. The completeness of the Galactic open cluster census, however,\nremains poorly understood. For the first time ever, we establish the selection\nfunction of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an\nopen-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the\nHunt & Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced\nour cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection\nand retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt & Reffert\ncatalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that\ndepends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data\ndensity, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple\nmodel accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\\% accuracy on our\ntraining data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders\nof magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why\ncertain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster\ndetectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper\nmotion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital\nspeed can result in an almost 3$\\times$ higher detection probability, depending\non its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and\nretrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other\nscience cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using\nour results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open\ncluster census. Our work will enable a number of brand new types of study, such\nas detailed comparisons between the Milky Way's cluster census and recent\nextragalactic cluster samples.\n",

      "title": "Extending the [C/N]-Age Calibration: Using Globular Clusters to Explore\n  Older and Metal-Poor Populations",
      "summary": "  In the coming years, detailed chemical abundances from large-scale\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic surveys will become available for vast numbers of\nstars across the Milky Way. Previous work has suggested that abundance ratios\nfrom these spectra can allow us to estimate ages from a large number of stars.\nThese data will be leveraged to calibrate chemical clocks to age-date field\nstars, as reliable stellar ages remain elusive. In this work, we extended our\nempirical relationship between stellar age and their carbon-to-nitrogen ([C/N])\nabundance ratio for evolved stars to older and more metal-poor stars by\ncombining the original open cluster calibration sample and four globular\nclusters: 47 Tuc, M 71, M 4, and M 5. With this extension, [C/N] can be used as\na chemical clock for evolved field stars to investigate not only regions within\nthe metal rich disk, but also more metal-poor regions of our Galaxy. We have\nestablished the [C/N]-age relationship for APOGEE DR17 red giant stars, that\nhave experienced the first dredge up but have not yet undergone any\nextra-mixing, in clusters usable for ages between $8.62 \\leq \\log(Age[{\\rm\nyr}]) \\leq 10.13$ and for metallicites of $-1.2\\leq[Fe/H]\\leq+0.3$. This\nrelationship can be uniformly applied to these stars within the APOGEE DR17\nsample. This measured [C/N]-age APOGEE DR17 relationship is also shown to be\nconsistent with stellar ages derived from asterosiesmic results of APOKASC and\nAPO-K2.\n",

      "summary": "  Due to wave interference, an ultralight light dark matter halo has\nstochastic, granular substructures which can scatter stars, leading to the\nheating of stellar distributions. Studies of this phenomenon have placed lower\nbounds on the ultralight dark matter mass. In this paper we investigate a\nnumber of relevant systematic effects, including: (1) the heating by the\ncentral soliton, (2) the self-gravity of the stars, (3) the suppression of\nheating in a tidally stripped halo, and (4) the tidal field suppression of\nheating when the stellar cluster is much smaller than the de Broglie\nwavelength. The first three effects are quantified by studying the dynamics of\nstellar particles in Schrodinger-Poisson simulations of ultralight dark matter\nhalos, while the last effect is studied using analytic approximations.\n",

In the first\n$1$--$3\\,$Myr, some cold gas falls to the system center where a central cluster\nbuilds up from sub-cluster mergers. There, the gas is photoionized,\npressurized, and chemically enriched by the newly formed VMSs, before being\nradiatively expelled in the next $\\sim1\\,\\rm Myr$. We find that both VMS\nfeedback and a high-surface-density progenitor GMC are necessary to reproduce\nthe observed nebular properties, such as high N/O, high pressure, and stellar\nproximity. Low metallicity ($Z \\le 0.004$) may be essential to avoid\noverproduction of carbon from WC stars. Such enrichment processes localized to\ncompact starburst events may have caused strong nitrogen emission from dense\nionized gas as observed in high-redshift galaxies such as GN-z11 and GS_3073.\n",

Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old\nstellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the\nold stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of\nmetal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The\nyoung stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all\ngalaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar.\nPreviously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar\nage on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the\naverage over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include\ncontributions of very young stars ($<6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of\nthe four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population\nsynthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust\nlanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of\ninterstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar\nclusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar\nwinds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of\nextinction are detected.\n",
