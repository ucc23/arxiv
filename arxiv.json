      "summary": "The near-infrared Calcium II Triplet (CaT), around 850nm, is a key metallicity indicator for red giant stars. We present a revised [Fe/H] calibration as a function of CaT line strengths and four luminosity indicators, including the $Gaia$ $G$-band, together with the classical $V$, $I$, and $K_s$ bandpasses. For this purpose, we used a sample of 366 red giant stars belonging to 25 globular and open clusters, complemented by 52 extremely metal-poor field giant stars. The CaT line strengths are determined by fitting Gaussian-Lorentzian combination profiles using the Python lmfit package, which utilises the algorithms implemented therein. The derived calibration is valid for a wide metallicity range, $-4$\\,dex$ \\lesssim \\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \\lesssim +0.15$, and for ages older than $\\sim$200 Myr. In addition, we performed a detailed assessment of how factors such as spectral resolution, spectral quality (expressed through the signal-to-noise ratio), and the algorithms used to constrain the line profiles affect the measured line strengths and the resulting metallicities.",

      "summary": "We report ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 0.1 pc resolution toward the super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39 in the N79 region of the LMC. The continuum emission has a sharp peak around the SSC candidate but is also widely distributed. We identify two continuum sources at the northern (N79S-1) and northwestern (N79S-2) positions of the SSC continuum peak, associated with CH$_3$OH emission. In addition to CH$_3$OH, we also detect H$_2$CO, H$_2$CS, CS, SO, CO, CN, and CCH at the positions of N79S-1 and N79S-2. The rotation diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and SO lines yields an average gas temperature of 13 $\\pm$ 0.4 K for N79S-1 and 15 $\\pm$ 0.9 K for N79S-2. Most emission lines exhibit line widths of less than 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with emissions from cold, dense molecular cloud cores. The abundance of cold CH$_3$OH gas is estimated to be (2.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)$\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ at N79S-1 and (4.5 $\\pm$2.5)$\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ at N79S-2. Despite the lower metallicity in the LMC, the CH$_3$OH abundance at N79S-1 is comparable to that of similar cold sources in our Galaxy. However, the formation of organic molecules is inhibited throughout the N79 regions, as can be seen in the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in most of the regions. The two positions N79S-1 and N79S-2 would be exceptional positions, where CH$_3$OH production is efficient. The possible origins of cold CH$_3$OH gas in these dense cores are discussed, along with a possible explanation for the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in the SSC candidate.",

      "summary": "Globular clusters (GCs), densely packed collections of thousands to millions of old stars, are excellent tracers of their host galaxies' evolutionary histories. Traditional methods for identifying GCs in galaxies rely on cuts over photometric catalogs and can yield source lists with high levels of contamination from compact background galaxies and foreground stars. In an era when large-scale sky surveys produce photometry for millions of sources, it is essential to employ flexible and scalable tools to reliably identify GCs in external galaxies. To prepare for surveys like Rubin/LSST, we need to explore practical methodological improvements and quantify the limitations inherent in the datasets. This paper investigates the selection of point-like extragalactic GCs exclusively in the $ugrizY$ color space. We use archival data to assemble an LSST-like photometric catalog for the Fornax Cluster containing labeled spectroscopically confirmed GCs, galaxies, and stars. From this catalog, using principal component analysis and non-linear auto-encoders (AEs), we construct inputs to random forest and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. We show that selecting GCs using ugrizY colors can lead to contamination rates of ~ 45%. If the principal components of the colors are used instead, this rate reduces to ~ 35% without increasing incompleteness. The AEs did not improve GC identification. To further reduce contamination and extract the full potential of LSST for star cluster studies, we argue for the need to augment photometric information with ancillary data (morphology from space-based missions and near-infrared photometry) before attempting to leverage more complex models.",

      "summary": "We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.",

We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.",

      "summary": "Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\\sim{10^{6}~\\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\\sim{10~\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$α$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\\sim10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\\sim10^{31}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\\%, 8\\%, and 18\\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$α$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.",

      "summary": "Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\\sim{10^{6}~\\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\\sim{10~\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$α$ maximum, respectively, for existing Chandra, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\\sim10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\\sim10^{31}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20%, 8%, and 18% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$α$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.",

      "summary": "Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $α$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\\log \\varepsilon$(Li)$_{\\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \\sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.",
