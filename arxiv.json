      "title": "Impact of gravity on changing magnetic field orientations in a sample of\n  massive protostellar clusters observed with ALMA",
      "summary": "  The magnetic field is integral to our understanding of the formation and\ndynamical evolution of molecular clouds and star formation within. We present a\npolarimetric survey of 17 massive protostellar cluster forming clumps, covered\nin 34 pointings in the 230-GHz window using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The two array configurations, C43-1 and\nC43-4, probe linearly polarized dust emission, hence the plane-of-the-sky\norientation of magnetic fields, at resolutions of 1\\arcsec\\ and 0\\arcsec.4 that\ncorrespond to approximately 0.01pc core and $10^3$ au envelope scales,\nrespectively. The relative orientations (ROs) of the magnetic field probed at\ntwo spatial scales are analyzed for the entire protostellar cluster sample and\nfor a subset of objects in NGC 6334. We found a bimodal distribution of ROs\nwith peaks at 0\\deg\\ (parallel) and 90\\deg (orthogonal) for the entire sample\ncombined as well as for NGC 6334. We investigate the physical origin of this\nbimodal distribution through a projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) analysis in\nrelation to column densities and local gravity in NGC 6334. We found an excess\nof parallel magnetic fields at column densities $> 10^{23}$ \\cmm. The\nunderlying cause of the RO distribution of the magnetic field is gravitational\ncollapse at higher gas densities, which drags and reorients the magnetic field\nas shown in the alignment between the magnetic field and the direction of\ngravitational forces. The distribution of ROs observed here is consistent with\nthe evolution of relative orientations of an initially sub-Alv\\'enic cloud that\nbecomes magnetically super-critical and super-Alv\\'enic as the cloud collapses\nto form stars.\n",

      "title": "The Missing Hard Photons of Little Red Dots: Their Incident Ionizing\n  Spectra Resemble Massive Stars",
      "summary": "  The nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) has largely been investigated through\ntheir continuum emission, with lines assumed to arise from a broad-line region.\nIn this paper, we instead use recombination lines to infer the intrinsic\nproperties of the central engine of LRDs. Our analysis first reveals a tension\nbetween the ionizing properties implied from H$\\alpha$ and HeII$\\,\\lambda$4686.\nThe high H$\\alpha$ EWs require copious H-ionizing photons, more than the bluest\nAGN ionizing spectra can provide. In contrast, HeII emission is marginally\ndetected, and its low EW is, at most, consistent with the softest AGN spectra.\nThe low HeII/H$\\beta$ ($\\sim10^{-2}$, $<20\\times$ local AGN median) further\npoints to an unusually soft ionizing spectrum. We extend our analysis to dense\ngas environments (the ``black-hole star'' hypothesis), and find that hydrogen\nrecombination lines become optically thick and lose diagnostic power, but HeII\nremains optically thin and a robust tracer. Photoionization modeling with\nCloudy rules out standard AGN accretion disk spectra. Alternative explanations\ninclude: exotic AGN with red rest-optical emission; a very high {\\it average}\noptical depth ($>10$) from gas/dust; and/or soft ionizing spectra with abundant\nH-ionizing photons, consistent with e.g., a cold accretion disk or a composite\nof AGN and stars. The latter is an intriguing scenario since high hydrogen\ndensities are highly conducive for star formation, and nuclear star clusters\nare found in the immediate vicinity of local massive black holes. While\nprevious studies have mostly focused on features dominated by the absorbing\nhydrogen cloud, the HeII-based diagnostic proposed here represents a crucial\nstep toward understanding the central engine of LRDs.\n",

      "title": "Tidal Tails of Nearby Open Clusters. II. A Review of Simulated\n  Properties and the Reliability of Observational Catalogues",
      "summary": "  Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections\nfor tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of\nthe reliability & completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work\naims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body\nsimulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature,\nand grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid\nof 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the\ntails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within\n500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &\ndynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails.\nResults: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the\ntails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &\nmass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of\nevolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude\nthat scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the\ninitial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by\nrecent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found\nthat 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The\nremaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for\nfurther analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of\nstars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent\nclusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent\nreliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential\nfor further validation & for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster\ndissolution & the Galactic potential.\n",

      "title": "Probing the farthest star clusters to the Small Magellanic Cloud",
      "summary": "  The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been tidally shaped by the interaction\nwith the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The scope of such an interaction has\nrecently been studied from different astrophysical properties of its star\ncluster population, which point to star clusters placed remarkably outside the\nknown extension of the galaxy. In this work we report results for three of the\nrecently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133,\nOGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we\nconfidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star\ncontamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood\ntechniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star\nnumber density radial profiles. Based on {\\it Gaia} astrometric data,\ncomplemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we\ncomputed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2\nGyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex),\nOGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk\nrotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and\nexhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while\nLindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong\nperturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational\ntrajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be\naccelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters\nin the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to\nconclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.\n",
