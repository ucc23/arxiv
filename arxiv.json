      "title": "Seeking Kinematic Association of Known FU Orionis Stars with Young\n  Clusters in Cygnus",
      "summary": "  Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our\nunderstanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way.\nFU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for\ntheir extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper\nmotion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori\nstars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and\nseek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or\nclusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look\nfor nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member\nstars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with\nthe 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North\nAmerica Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC\n6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud\nLDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in\nboth position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we\ntrace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster.\nColor-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of\npre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical\nassociation between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby\nclusters.\n",

      "title": "Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters\n  in giant elliptical galaxies",
      "summary": "  It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist\nwith the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers -\nunavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars.\nHowever, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a\nthird of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs\nin giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could\nexplain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major\nmerger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a\ngravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two\ncompeting effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become\nbound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil\nvelocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls\nback due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.\nAt intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become\nimportant, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background\nstellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the\ngalaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have\nrealistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to\nobserved systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing\nSMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable\ncolors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low\nellipticities.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical model of Praesepe and its tidal tails",
      "summary": "  Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the\nMilky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on\nthe initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models\ntailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in\nthe Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of\nPraesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the\nmass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model,\nwe investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail.\nMethods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of\nPraesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents\none star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and\nthe initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based\non this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars\nin the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes.\nResults. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated\nstar formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion,\nadopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially\n7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass\nsegregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the\nself-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular\nmomentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping\nis about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc,\nwhere tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift\nof the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect\nis not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.\n",
