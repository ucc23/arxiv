      "title": "The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole\n  accretion through an $α$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved\n  interstellar medium",
      "summary": "  We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different\nstellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We\nemploy a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius\nof the $\\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the\nself-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of\nstellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,\nproducing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,\nfragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding\nthe IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the\nISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both\nradiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:\nit survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being\nreplenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes\nplace. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling\nthe combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH\ngrowth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with\nIMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy\nmodels explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with\nfuture observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA,\nand make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift\nsupermassive BHs observed by JWST.\n",

      "title": "Validating Open Cluster Candidates with Photometric Bayesian Evidence",
      "summary": "  The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission\nare significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations,\nposing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO),\nwe present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the\ncolor--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two\ncompeting models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a\npure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the\nstatistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and\nrandom fields show that a threshold of BF > 100 effectively distinguishes\ngenuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a\nrobust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The\nframework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating\nkinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems,\nincluding candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.\n",

The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify\nan ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the\nMF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source\nimplementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.\n",

      "summary": "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $M_{BH} \\approx 10^{3-5} M_\\odot$) play\na critical role in understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in\nthe early universe. In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated\nmeasurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed\nwith the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral\n(HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the\ndistance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the\nnorthern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by\nidentifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to\nbe nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct\nsimulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax\nCluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We\nuse the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nimaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock\nobservations with the {\\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM).\nThese mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations,\nemploying JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their\nassociated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar\nkinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH}\n\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$ out to distances of $\\sim$20 Mpc.\n",

      "summary": "  We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of nine open clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood using kinematic data from Gaia DR 3, aiming to identify\npotential dynamical signatures of stellar-mass black holes through a comparison\nof theoretical and observed dispersion profiles. The selected clusters include\nLP2373 gp4, NGC 1980, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, NGC 3532, NGC 6475, UBC 7, Praesepe,\nand Pleiades. We refine the center positions of the clusters with the Meanshift\nalgorithm. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we calculate the velocity\ndispersion for each cluster and construct one-dimensional velocity dispersion\nprofiles. NGC 2516, NGC 3532, and NGC 6475 show potential central cusps in\ntheir radial velocity dispersion profiles, which may indicate the presence of\nstellar-mass black holes. LP2373 gp4, NGC 6475, and Praesepe all display a\nnegative correlation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, indicating\nthese clusters are approaching energy equipartition or expanding. NGC 2516 and\nNGC 3532 exhibit a positive dependence between velocity dispersion and stellar\nmass, which may be attributed to the preferential ejection of massive stars\nfollowing dynamical interactions involving binaries or black holes. These two\nclusters are the only two that are dynamical not relaxed and are closest to\nvirial equilibrium. We compare the observations with N-body simulations of star\nclusters. A comparison of observed and simulated velocity dispersion profiles\nreveals that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit lower proper motion dispersions than\nmodel clusters. Better agreement with the observed profiles is achieved for\nmodel clusters with larger ages. This suggests that the observed clusters may\nhave undergone rapid dynamical evolution. Our results suggest that NGC 2516 and\nNGC 3532 may host at least two stellar-mass black holes each.\n",

      "title": "Limits on Stellar Flybys in the Solar Birth Cluster",
      "summary": "  The orbits of small bodies in the outer solar system are particularly\nsensitive to gravitational perturbations, including stellar flybys. Stellar\nclusters, with low velocity dispersions and high number densities, can be the\nsource of strong and frequent flybys. As a result, we can infer what properties\nof the solar birth environment would be incompatible with the structure of the\nouter solar system observed today. Here, we explore with $n-$body simulations\nthe implications of the low inclinations ($i < 20^{\\circ}$) of the distant\nsednoids (objects with perihelia $q > 40 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$ and semimajor axes $a\n> 400 \\mathrm{\\; AU}$) for the properties of the solar birth cluster. We find\nthat the existence of these orbits, if they were in place in the Sun's birth\ncluster phase, would limit the product of the stellar number density and the\nSun's residence time in the birth cluster to $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{\\;\nMyr \\; pc^{-3}}$, as compared to the weaker limit $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^4\n\\mathrm{\\; Myr \\; pc^{-3}}$ implied by the low inclinations of the cold\nclassical Kuiper belt.\n",
