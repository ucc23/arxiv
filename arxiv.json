      "title": "Tidal Tails of Nearby Open Clusters. II. A Review of Simulated\n  Properties and the Reliability of Observational Catalogues",
      "summary": "  Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections\nfor tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of\nthe reliability & completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work\naims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body\nsimulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature,\nand grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid\nof 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the\ntails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within\n500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &\ndynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails.\nResults: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the\ntails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &\nmass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of\nevolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude\nthat scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the\ninitial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by\nrecent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found\nthat 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The\nremaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for\nfurther analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of\nstars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent\nclusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent\nreliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential\nfor further validation & for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster\ndissolution & the Galactic potential.\n",

      "title": "Probing the farthest star clusters to the Small Magellanic Cloud",
      "summary": "  The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has been tidally shaped by the interaction\nwith the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The scope of such an interaction has\nrecently been studied from different astrophysical properties of its star\ncluster population, which point to star clusters placed remarkably outside the\nknown extension of the galaxy. In this work we report results for three of the\nrecently identified most external SMC star clusters, OGLE-CL-SMC0133,\nOGLE-CL-SMC0237, and Lindsay~116, using deep GEMINI GMOS imaging. Once we\nconfidently cleaned their color-magnitude diagrams from field star\ncontamination, we estimated their fundamental parameters applying likelihood\ntechniques. We also derived their structural parameters from normalized star\nnumber density radial profiles. Based on {\\it Gaia} astrometric data,\ncomplemented with kinematics information available in the literature, we\ncomputed the 3D components of their space velocities. With similar ages (~ 2.2\nGyr) and moderately metal-poor overall abundances ([Fe/H] = -1.0 - -0.7 dex),\nOGLE-CL-SMC0237 is placed at 2.6 kpc from the SMC center and shares its disk\nrotation; OGLE-CL-SMC0133 is located at 7.6 kpc from the galaxy center and\nexhibits a kinematics marginally similar to the SMC rotation disk, while\nLindsay~116 placed at 15.7 kpc from the center of the SMC is facing strong\nperturbations of its orbital motion with respect to an ordered rotational\ntrajectory. Furthermore, its internal dynamical evolution would seem to be\naccelerated -- it seems kinematically older -- in comparison with star clusters\nin the outskirts of relatively isolated galaxies. These outcomes lead to\nconclude that Lindsay~116 is subject to LMC tides.\n",
