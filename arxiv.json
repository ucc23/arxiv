      "title": "Distance measurements from the internal dynamics of globular clusters:\n  Application to the Sombrero galaxy (M 104)",
      "summary": "  Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive\ngalaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between\ntheir internal stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling\naccurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity\ndispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594,\nthe Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions\nfor 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104\nusing high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with\nFLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions\nrange from $\\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of\n$\\Delta\\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band\nmagnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\\sigma > 4$ km\ns$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to\nM 104, finding $D=9.00\\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the\nMilky Way and M 31 $M_V-\\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the\nluminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than\nthe mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band\ndynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 \\pm 0.8\nM_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is\nhigher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in\nCentaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD\nrelation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.\n",

      "title": "Tidal Disruption of Super Star Clusters as the origin of Bluish Light at\n  the inner region of the Perseus Cluster Central Galaxy",
      "summary": "  Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc\nout to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and\nbroadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar\nmetallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having\nsuper-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160\nMyr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising\nthe central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for\na combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\\times$ 10$^9$ $\\rm M_\\odot$. A\nmultitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have\nbrightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters\n(SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively\nshallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially\nlarger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far)\nexceeding ~1 $\\times$ 10$^9$ $\\rm M_\\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light\n-- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted\nstar clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that,\nbeginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275,\nleaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the\nintracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were\ntidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy,\nwith the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.\n",

      "title": "Nuclear discs in disc galaxies: structural properties and scaling\n  relations",
      "summary": "  The presence of nuclear discs in barred disc galaxies has been demonstrated\nin studies on stellar structures and kinematics. It is thus imperative to\nestablish their fundamental properties and scaling relations, which can help\nunderstanding their connection to other central stellar structures, including\nnuclear star clusters. In this Letter, we use results from the structural\nanalysis and star formation histories of a sample of galaxies with nuclear\ndiscs to show the distributions of fundamental parameters and scaling\nrelations. Our analysis shows that the nuclear disc mass-size relation, and the\nrelation between the nuclear disc mass and the stellar mass of its host galaxy,\nare - at face value - different from the corresponding relations for nuclear\nstar clusters, but marginally compatible given the uncertainties. This sets\nconstraints to scenarios in which their formation is connected. We also find\nthat the nuclear disc in the Milky Way is on the shorter end of the\ndistribution of sizes set by nuclear discs in other galaxies. This is the first\nanalysis of this kind for kinematically confirmed nuclear discs, and further\nunderstanding of the properties of the nuclear disc in the Milky Way and other\ngalaxies is necessary to corroborate these results.\n",

      "summary": "  Stellar substructures within tidal debris preserve information about their\nprogenitor galaxies' properties, offering insights into hierarchical mass\nassembly. We examine a compact stellar system (CSS) around the nearby spiral\ngalaxy NGC 7531, including the shell-like tidal debris. Our goals are to\ndetermine the nature of the CSS, reconstruct the accretion history, and\nunderstand how the large, diffuse shell-like structure formed. We present\nphotometric measurements of the shell-like debris and CSS using DESI Legacy\nImaging Survey (LS) data. We obtained Keck/LRIS spectroscopic data for the CSS\nto confirm its association with NGC 7531 and to derive its star formation\nhistory (SFH). Deep ($\\sim$27.9 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) amateur telescope images\nenabled complete characterization of the tidal debris structure. We confirm the\nCSS is associated with NGC 7531. We rename it NGC 7531-UCD1, since its stellar\nmass ($3.7_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\\times 10^6$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), half-light radius\n($R_{h} = 0.13 \\pm 0.05$ arcsec) and SFH place it as an ultra-compact dwarf\ngalaxy (UCD). NGC 7531-UCD1 was likely a nuclear star cluster (NSC) that was\ntidally stripped into a UCD- this is further supported by the presence of tidal\ntails. We quantify the shell-like debris' mass as $M_\\star\\sim 3$--$11\\times\n10^8 M_\\odot$, implying a merger mass ratio of ~300:1 to 10:1. Our amateur\ntelescope images confirm new pieces of debris, previously unclear in the DESI\nLS images. N-body simulations reproduce the tidal features, requiring a near\nradial orbit of the progenitor with two pericentric passages. The first passage\ncoincides with the measured star formation enhancement ~1 Gyr ago. Our findings\nagree with predictions about the NSC to UCD formation pathway via tidal\nstripping, and further confirm the presence of these objects outside of our\nMilky Way.\n",

      "summary": "  We present 32 new spectroscopic-binary orbits from our extended\nradial-velocity (RV) survey of the old ($6.4 \\pm 0.2$ Gyr) open cluster NGC\n188. Using data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) and APOGEE-2, this work\nnearly doubles the temporal baseline of the previous RV study of NGC 188. We\nobtain orbital solutions within a stellar sample that spans a magnitude range\nof $10.8 \\leq \\mathrm{G} \\leq 16.5 \\; (0.9\\mbox{-}1.2 \\; {M_\\odot})$. With\nrevised membership determinations using Gaia DR3 proper-motions and parallaxes,\nwe reassess the cluster binary frequency and period-eccentricity distribution,\nfinding an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency of $33.1 \\% \\pm 3.8\\%$ for\nperiods less than $10^4$ days. We also find a tidal-circularization period of\n$14.4^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ days. We find evidence that giants are deficient in\nshort-period orbits, and suggest that the missing giants may have undergone\nmass transfer and in part formed the population of blue straggler stars and\nblue lurkers. Among the binaries of note, we highlight WOCS 3953 and WOCS 4945,\nlong-period candidate mass-transfer systems that exhibit possible UV excess.\n",

      "summary": "  Open clusters are one of the best astrophysical laboratories we have\navailable for stellar astrophysics studies. This work presents metallicities\nand individual abundances for fourteen M dwarfs and six G dwarfs from two\nwell-known open clusters: Hyades and Coma Berenices. Our analysis is based on\nnear-infrared (1.51--1.69 $\\mu$m), high-resolution ($R \\sim 22,500$) spectra\nobtained from the SDSS IV/APOGEE Survey. Using one-dimensional, plane-parallel\nMARCS model atmospheres, the APOGEE line list, and the Turbospectrum radiative\ntransfer code in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derived spectroscopic\nstellar parameters for the M dwarfs, along with abundances of 13 elements (C,\nO, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for both M and G dwarfs. We\nfind a high degree of chemical homogeneity within each cluster when comparing\nabundances derived from M and G dwarfs: $\\delta$[M/H] (M dwarfs -- G dwarfs) of\n0.01$\\pm$0.04, and 0.02$\\pm$0.03 for the Hyades and Coma Berenices,\nrespectively. The overall cluster metallicities derived from M dwarfs (Hyades:\n0.16$\\pm$0.03 and Coma Berenices: 0.02$\\pm$0.06) are consistent with previous\nliterature determinations. Finally, we demonstrate the value of M dwarfs as key\ntracers in galactic archaeology, emphasizing their potential for studying\ngalactic metallicity gradients and chemical evolution.\n",
