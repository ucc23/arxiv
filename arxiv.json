      "summary": "The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).",

      "summary": "Dust lifetime derived from an isolated supernova (SN) evolution in the interstellar medium is known to be an order of magnitude shorter than the time needed to replenish dust mass by its production in various Galactic sources. We show, using 3-D numerical hydrodynamical simulations, that destruction of dust in the case of multiple SNe in a star cluster is markedly different from that in an isolated SN. We find that the mass of dust destroyed in the bubble does not grow for a considerable time, while SNe continue to explode. This regime is attained at saturation timescale, which is proportional to SNe rate in cluster. We show that the mass of dust destroyed in bubble per SN decreases for higher SN rate. Thus, the destruction efficiency -- defined as the ratio of the the total mass of dust destroyed by clustered SNe to that destroyed by the same number of isolated SNe -- in bubbles evolved in a homogeneous medium drops for massive clusters, e.g. around clusters with $M_\\ast > 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ it is less $0.4$\\%. For lower mass clusters, the efficiency is proportional to the average time delay between SNe. We found that each cluster with $M_\\ast < 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ destroys the same mass of dust as a single isolated SN. In a clumpy medium in bubbles formed around clusters with $M_\\ast \\sim 4\\times 10^4 M_\\odot$ and up to 4 times around $M_\\ast \\sim 8\\times 10^5 M_\\odot$. We argue that the interstellar dust swept up by multiple SNe almost completely survives in the shells of bubbles around such massive clusters. Therefore, the destruction of the interstellar dust is controlled by SNe in low-mass clusters. We point out that the interstellar dust lifetime for a given SN rate is at least a factor $\\sim 10$ longer as compared to the estimates derived from an isolated SN. (abridged)",

      "summary": "Study the ionized gas in metal-poor environments is key to understanding the mechanisms regulating galaxy evolution. However, most of the previous studies of extragalactic HII regions rely on unresolved observations of gaseous structures. We study the south-western, spatially resolved, HII region of Leo A, one of the most studied isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using archival VIMOS-IFU/VLT data, we explored its gaseous structure through optical emission lines to gain insights into the present-day drivers of gas physics in this dIrr, and we place constraints on the chemical evolution scenario responsible for this low chemical enrichment. The emission line maps reveal that the strongest emission comes from the south-west region. A stratified distribution of ionic species was detected, likely powered by the young star cluster at the nebular centre. HST/ACS data show that the brightest star is in the centre of both the HII region and the star cluster. Photoionization production rates derived indicate that this star can sustain the ionization budget to power the HII region, although subject to the assumed electron density. Using the direct method, we derived a metallicity of $12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})=7.29\\pm0.06$ dex, increasing to $7.46\\pm0.09$ dex after correcting for temperature fluctuations, placing Leo A in the low-mass end of the MZR. Chemical evolution models suggest that, under constant accretion, the stellar mass growth and metal enrichment over the last 10 Gyr are successfully reproduced by both leaky-box and gas-regulator models. Those results are similar to those found in SagDIG, supporting a picture in which the present-day evolution of Leo A is dominated by stellar feedback processes. The combination of mass loss mechanisms and accretion events reproduces its chemical evolution, suggesting that Leo A has evolved under a gas equilibrium regime across its lifetime.",
