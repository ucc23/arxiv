      "title": "Seeking Kinematic Association of Known FU Orionis Stars with Young\n  Clusters in Cygnus",
      "summary": "  Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our\nunderstanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way.\nFU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for\ntheir extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper\nmotion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori\nstars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and\nseek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or\nclusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look\nfor nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member\nstars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with\nthe 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North\nAmerica Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC\n6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud\nLDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in\nboth position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we\ntrace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster.\nColor-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of\npre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical\nassociation between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby\nclusters.\n",

      "title": "Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters\n  in giant elliptical galaxies",
      "summary": "  It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist\nwith the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers -\nunavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars.\nHowever, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a\nthird of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs\nin giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could\nexplain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major\nmerger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a\ngravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two\ncompeting effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become\nbound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil\nvelocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls\nback due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.\nAt intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become\nimportant, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background\nstellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the\ngalaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have\nrealistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to\nobserved systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing\nSMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable\ncolors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low\nellipticities.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical model of Praesepe and its tidal tails",
      "summary": "  Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the\nMilky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on\nthe initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models\ntailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in\nthe Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of\nPraesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the\nmass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model,\nwe investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail.\nMethods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of\nPraesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents\none star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and\nthe initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based\non this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars\nin the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes.\nResults. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated\nstar formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion,\nadopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially\n7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass\nsegregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the\nself-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular\nmomentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping\nis about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc,\nwhere tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift\nof the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect\nis not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.\n",

      "title": "Characterizing the star cluster populations in Stephan's Quintet using\n  HST and JWST observations",
      "summary": "  Stephan's Quintet (SQ) is a local compact galaxy group system that exhibits\nsignificant star formation activity. A history of tidal interactions between\nits four member galaxies and a recent collision between an intruder galaxy and\nthe original group are associated with active star formation, particularly in\nmany shocked regions in the intra-group medium. Using an existing star cluster\ncandidate (SCC) catalog constructed from HST UV/optical images, we integrate\nflux measurements from five near-infrared filters (F090W, F150W, F200W, F277W,\nF356W) obtained from JWST NIRCam observations in 2022. Leveraging the extended\nphotometric baseline from HST and JWST, spanning ~300 nm to ~3500 nm, we\nperform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the CIGALE code to\nderive reliable estimates of age, mass, and extinction for the 1,588\nhigh-confidence SCCs. We confirm earlier results that very young SCCs (~a few\nMyr) are predominantly located along previously identified shock regions near\nthe merging galaxies, while older (>100 Myr) and globular clusters are more\nwidely distributed. Our analysis shows that NIR photometry helps break the\nage-extinction degeneracy, reclassifying many SCCs from older to younger,\nmoderately dust-extincted clusters when added to HST-based SED fits. We also\nobserve a strong spatial correlation between young clusters and CO-traced\nmolecular gas, although active star formation is present in several regions\nwith no detectable CO. We find that the two prominent epochs of star formation,\naround 5 Myr and 200 Myr, correspond to the two major interaction events in SQ\nthat gave rise to the observed extended tidal features.\n",

      "summary": "  The formation of the Universe's first luminous stellar structures depends on\nthe unique conditions at \"Cosmic Dawn,\" which are set by the underlying\ncosmological model and early baryonic physics. Observations suggest that\nhigh-$z$ star clusters reached stellar surface densities above $10^5 M_\\odot$\npc$^{-2}$, suggesting scenarios where models predict that the ability of\nstellar feedback to counter gravitational collapse is severely limited. We\ninvestigate the first star clusters in a suite of AREPO simulations, which\nexplore the capacity for $\\Lambda$CDM halos to maximally form high-density\nsystems without feedback. We include the effects of the supersonic baryon-dark\nmatter streaming velocity, an effect that impacts gas density and distribution\nin early minihalos. We show that early star clusters can reach high densities\neven in regions of strong supersonic streaming, provided feedback is weak. We\nanalyze the interplay of the stream velocity and the dynamical processes of\nstructure formation, finding that JWST has the opportunity to detect the\nbrightest, most massive objects in our computational box. The detection of\nindividual $z\\geq12$ Pop III star clusters below $10^7M_\\odot$ is challenging,\nalthough lensing could reveal these objects in rare configurations, especially\nif a top-heavy IMF is present. We find that accounting for baryonic clusters\nseparately from dark matter halos complicates predictions for the faint-end of\nthe high-$z$ UVLF, with competing effects from the stream velocity and low-mass\nclusters outside of halos. Finally, we explore clustering of star clusters as a\npromising probe of the stream velocity in these systems.\n",

      "title": "First direct detection of an RR Lyrae star conclusively associated with\n  an intermediate-age cluster",
      "summary": "  RR Lyrae stars have long been considered unequivocal tracers of old (>10 Gyr)\nand metal-poor ($\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-0.5$) stellar populations. First, because\nthese populations are where they are readily found and because, according to\ncanonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only\npopulations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however,\nare challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR\nLyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct\nevidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these\nstars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and\nrobust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically\nassociated member stars from the Hunt & Reffert database by crossmatching\nagainst a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys\n(\\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV).\n  We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of\nthe 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions\nand their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low\nprobability ($0.049\\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae\nand provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its\nposition in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of\ndebate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of\nthe existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally\nexpected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.\n",

      "summary": "  The scope of this literature review is observations of the products of\nfirst-stage evolution for binaries having components with M < 2 $M_\\odot$. A\ntaxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs (\"blue stragglers\"), giants\n(\"yellow stragglers\"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars (\"sub-subgiants\"\nand \"red stragglers\"). This literature review is organized according to this\ntaxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star\nclusters, and the Galactic field.\n  This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and\nFriends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu &\nPols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi:\nwww.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-071221-054402). It\nis intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual\nReview of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the\ncommon and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution\nproducts is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key\nobservational results are referenced in this literature review.\n  The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations\nsubsequently updated.\n",

      "title": "Supergiant GCIRS 22 in the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster: Revised alpha\n  abundances",
      "summary": "  Context: The chemical abundances of alpha-elements in Galactic Centre (GC)\nsupergiants provide key insights into the chemical enrichment and star\nformation history of the Milky Way's Nuclear Star Cluster. Previous studies\nhave reported enhanced alpha-element abundances, raising questions about the\nchemical evolution of this unique region.\n  Aims: We aim to reassess the alpha-element abundances in the GC supergiant\nGCIRS 22 using updated spectral modelling and non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE) corrections to resolve discrepancies from earlier abundance\nanalyses.\n  Methods: High-resolution near-infrared spectra of GCIRS 22 were analysed\nusing contemporary line lists and precise stellar parameters derived from\nscandium line diagnostics. We applied comprehensive NLTE corrections to\naccurately determine the abundances of silicon and calcium.\n  Results: Our analysis reveals solar-scale alpha abundances ([Ca/Fe] = 0.06\n$\\pm$ 0.07; [Si/Fe] = $-$0.08 $\\pm$ 0.20) for GCIRS 22, significantly lower\nthan previous LTE-based findings. NLTE corrections reduce the calcium abundance\nby approximately 0.3,dex compared to LTE estimates, aligning our results with\nrecent studies and highlighting the importance of accurate NLTE modelling.\n  Conclusions: The solar-scale alpha-element abundances observed in GCIRS 22\nsuggest that recent star formation in the region has not been dominated by Type\nII supernovae, such as those expected from a recent starburst. Our findings\nsupport a scenario of episodic star formation, characterized by intermittent\nbursts separated by extended quiescent phases, or potentially driven by gas\ninflows from the inner disk, funnelled by the Galactic bar. Future\ncomprehensive NLTE studies of additional GC stars will be essential for\nrefining our understanding of the region's chemical evolution and star\nformation history.\n",
