      "title": "Place of the Radcliffe Wave in the Local System",
      "summary": "  A review of publications devoted to the study of the characteristics of the\nRadcliffe wave has been given. The advent of mass measurements of radial\nvelocities of stars has recently led to a number of interesting results\nobtained from the analysis of spatial velocities of stars and open star\nclusters. An important place in the study has been given to issues related to\nthe clarification of the direct or indirect influence of magnetic fields on the\nprocess of formation of the Radcliffe wave. The hypothesis of Parker\ninstability of the galactic magnetic field as one of the reasons for the\nformation of wave-type inhomogeneities in the galactic disk has been discussed.\n",

      "title": "A possible trigger of the multiple population phenomenon in star\n  clusters",
      "summary": "  Multiple populations (MPs) is a intra-star cluster phenomenon consisting in\nstar-to-star variation of the abundance of some light chemical elements. They\nhave been observed in many star clusters, most of them old globular clusters,\npopulating the Milky Way and other satellite galaxies. Since the study of MPs\nbecame more systematic, different astrophysical parameters have been claimed to\nbe the main responsible for its occurrence. However, at the present time, no\nattempt would seem to have solved this conundrum. This work deals with a\npotential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational\nevidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its\nin others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time\nintervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during\nthe galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time\nintervals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star\nclusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs. This lower star\ncluster mass limit would marginally depend on the star cluster age.\n",

      "title": "The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole\n  accretion through an $α$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved\n  interstellar medium",
      "summary": "  We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different\nstellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We\nemploy a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius\nof the $\\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the\nself-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of\nstellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,\nproducing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,\nfragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding\nthe IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the\nISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both\nradiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:\nit survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being\nreplenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes\nplace. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling\nthe combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH\ngrowth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with\nIMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy\nmodels explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with\nfuture observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA,\nand make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift\nsupermassive BHs observed by JWST.\n",

      "summary": "  The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission\nare significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations,\nposing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO),\nwe present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the\ncolor--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two\ncompeting models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a\npure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the\nstatistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and\nrandom fields show that a threshold of BF > 100 effectively distinguishes\ngenuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a\nrobust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The\nframework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating\nkinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems,\nincluding candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.\n",

The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify\nan ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the\nMF estimates are considered most reliable.

      "summary": "  Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close\nencounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary\nsystems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides\na natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical\nsimulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and\nREBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues\nembedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an\n$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either\nan extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form\nKuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk\ninteractions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar\nencounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with\nejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that\ncometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of\nplanet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the\narchitecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.\n",

      "title": "The velocity dispersion profile of nine open clusters in the solar\n  neighborhood",
      "summary": "  We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of nine open clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood using kinematic data from Gaia DR 3, aiming to identify\npotential dynamical signatures of stellar-mass black holes through a comparison\nof theoretical and observed dispersion profiles. The selected clusters include\nLP2373 gp4, NGC 1980, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, NGC 3532, NGC 6475, UBC 7, Praesepe,\nand Pleiades. We refine the center positions of the clusters with the Meanshift\nalgorithm. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we calculate the velocity\ndispersion for each cluster and construct one-dimensional velocity dispersion\nprofiles. NGC 2516, NGC 3532, and NGC 6475 show potential central cusps in\ntheir radial velocity dispersion profiles, which may indicate the presence of\nstellar-mass black holes. LP2373 gp4, NGC 6475, and Praesepe all display a\nnegative correlation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, indicating\nthese clusters are approaching energy equipartition or expanding. NGC 2516 and\nNGC 3532 exhibit a positive dependence between velocity dispersion and stellar\nmass, which may be attributed to the preferential ejection of massive stars\nfollowing dynamical interactions involving binaries or black holes. These two\nclusters are the only two that are dynamical not relaxed and are closest to\nvirial equilibrium. We compare the observations with N-body simulations of star\nclusters. A comparison of observed and simulated velocity dispersion profiles\nreveals that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit lower proper motion dispersions than\nmodel clusters. Better agreement with the observed profiles is achieved for\nmodel clusters with larger ages. This suggests that the observed clusters may\nhave undergone rapid dynamical evolution. Our results suggest that NGC 2516 and\nNGC 3532 may host at least two stellar-mass black holes each.\n",

      "summary": "  Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are\nhypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole,\npossibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and\nlikely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear\nstar cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the\nsupermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black\nhole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our\nmodel. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under\nreasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption\nevents and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal\ndisruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture\nrate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we\ncomment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.\n",
