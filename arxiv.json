      "title": "oMEGACat. VIII. A Subpopulation Census of ω Centauri",
      "summary": "  An understanding of the assembly history of the complex star cluster Omega\nCentauri has long been sought after, with many studies separating the stars on\nthe color-magnitude diagram into multiple groupings across small magnitude\nranges. Utilizing the oMEGACat combined astro-photometric and spectroscopic\ndataset we parse 14 subpopulations from the upper red-giant branch to below the\nmain-sequence turnoff. We combine our results with previous works to estimate\nthe age and age spread of each population. We find that the chemically enhanced\n(P2) populations are all ~1 Gyr younger (~11.6 Gyr old) and have significantly\nhigher intrinsic age spreads (0.6 Gyr) than the primordial (P1) populations\n(~12.6 Gyr old, 0.3 Gyr spread), with the intermediate (Im) populations falling\nin between the two. Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome\nDiagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1\nand P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and\nex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent\nwith some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model\ncan explain all observed features of the subpopulations.\n",

      "title": "Shock-driven heating in the circumnuclear star-forming regions of NGC\n  7582: Insights from JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS spectroscopy",
      "summary": "  We present combined JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy\ndata of the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of the highly dust obscured\nSeyfert 2 galaxy NGC 7582, which is part of the sample of AGN in the Galaxy\nActivity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Spatially resolved analysis of the\npure rotational H$_2$ lines (S(1)-S(7)) reveals a characteristic power-law\ntemperature distribution in different apertures, with the two prominent\nsouthern star-forming regions exhibiting unexpectedly high molecular gas\ntemperatures, comparable to those in the AGN powered nuclear region. We\ninvestigate potential heating mechanisms including direct AGN photoionisation,\nUV fluorescent excitation from young star clusters, and shock excitation. We\nfind that shock heating gives the most plausible explanation, consistent with\nmultiple near- and mid-IR tracers and diagnostics. Using photoionisation models\nfrom the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox, we quantify the ISM conditions in\nthe different regions, determining that the southern star-forming regions have\na high density ($n_H \\sim 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and are irradiated by a moderate\nUV radiation field ($G_0 \\sim 10^{3}$ Habing). Fitting a suite of Paris-Durham\nshock models to the rotational H$_2$ lines, as well as rovibrational 1-0 S(1),\n1-0 S(2), and 2-1 S(1) H$_2$ emission lines, we find that a slow ($v_s \\sim 10$\nkm/s) C-type shock is likely responsible for the elevated temperatures. Our\nanalysis loosely favours local starburst activity as the driver of the shocks\nand circumnuclear gas dynamics in NGC 7582, though the possibility of an AGN\njet contribution cannot be excluded.\n",

      "summary": "  Multiple populations (MPs) is a intra-star cluster phenomenon consisting in\nstar-to-star variation of the abundance of some light chemical elements. They\nhave been observed in many star clusters, most of them old globular clusters,\npopulating the Milky Way and other satellite galaxies. Since the study of MPs\nbecame more systematic, different astrophysical parameters have been claimed to\nbe the main responsible for its occurrence. However, at the present time, no\nattempt would seem to have solved this conundrum. This work deals with a\npotential trigger of the MPs phenomenon, based on the gathered observational\nevidence of the existence of MPs in some star clusters and the absence of its\nin others. We found that star clusters with MPs mostly formed during time\nintervals of intense star formation activity in a galaxy, for instance during\nthe galaxy formation epoch, a close galaxy encounter, etc. At those time\nintervals where relative peaks in the galaxy star formation rate occur, star\nclusters with masses above a lower mass limit harbour MPs. This lower star\ncluster mass limit would marginally depend on the star cluster age.\n",

      "title": "The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole\n  accretion through an $α$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved\n  interstellar medium",
      "summary": "  We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different\nstellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We\nemploy a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius\nof the $\\alpha$-accretion disc ($<0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the\nself-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of\nstellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively,\nproducing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included,\nfragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding\nthe IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the\nISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both\nradiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent:\nit survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being\nreplenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes\nplace. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling\nthe combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH\ngrowth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with\nIMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy\nmodels explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with\nfuture observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA,\nand make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift\nsupermassive BHs observed by JWST.\n",

Tests on confirmed clusters and\nrandom fields show that a threshold of BF > 100 effectively distinguishes\ngenuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a\nrobust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The\nframework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating\nkinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems,\nincluding candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.\n",

      "summary": "  We present a homogeneous catalog of 1,232 open clusters with precisely\ndetermined ages, metallicities, distances, extinctions, and stellar mass\nfunction (MF) slopes, derived from Gaia DR3 data. The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify\nan ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the\nMF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source\nimplementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.\n",

      "summary": "  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $M_{BH} \\approx 10^{3-5} M_\\odot$) play\na critical role in understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in\nthe early universe. In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated\nmeasurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed\nwith the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral\n(HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the\ndistance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the\nnorthern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by\nidentifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to\nbe nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct\nsimulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax\nCluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We\nuse the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nimaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock\nobservations with the {\\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM).\nThese mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations,\nemploying JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their\nassociated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar\nkinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH}\n\\gtrsim 10^5 M_\\odot$ out to distances of $\\sim$20 Mpc.\n",

      "title": "Implications for the formation of Oort cloud-like structures and\n  interstellar comets in dense environments",
      "summary": "  Most stars form in dense stellar environments, where frequent close\nencounters can strongly perturb and reshape the early architecture of planetary\nsystems. The solar system, with its rich population of distant comets, provides\na natural laboratory to study these processes. We perform detailed numerical\nsimulations using the LonelyPlanets framework that combines NBODY6++GPU and\nREBOUND, to explore the evolution of debris disks around solar system analogues\nembedded in stellar clusters. Two initial configurations are considered, an\n$Extended$ and a $Compact$ model, each containing four giant planets and either\nan extended or compact debris disk. We find that compact disks primarily form\nKuiper belt and scattered disk-like populations through planet-disk\ninteractions, while extended disks are more strongly shaped by stellar\nencounters, producing Oort cloud-like structures and interstellar comets with\nejection velocities of 1-3 km/s. Stellar perturbations are most effective for\nencounter inclinations between $0^{\\circ}$ and $30^{\\circ}$, giving rise to\ndistinct dynamical populations, like Sednoids, and inner Oort cloud analogues,\nand a characteristic tail in semi-major axis-eccentricity space. In coplanar\nencounters, the disk remains largely flattened, whereas polar flybys\nredistribute angular momentum vertically, producing nearly isotropic outer\npopulations that resemble an emerging Oort cloud. Our results suggest that\ncometary reservoirs and interstellar objects are natural byproducts of\nplanet-disk interactions and stellar flybys in dense clusters, linking the\narchitecture of outer planetary systems to their birth environments.\n",
