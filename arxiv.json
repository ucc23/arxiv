      "summary": "The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse a sample of probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. While both populations are found throughout the association, the OB stars lie preferentially on the side nearest the Galactic plane, while the YSOs are generally younger and more strongly clustered around molecular-cloud clumps detected in 13CO MWISP data. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales <2 pc, two-point velocity statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual, but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The expansion of the H II region Sh 2-54, powered by the association's OB stars, may be accelerating the star-forming cloud away from the plane given the system's geometry, plausibly inducing the vertical stellar velocity gradient. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.",

      "summary": "Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\\sim{10^{6}~\\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\\sim{10~\\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$α$ maximum, respectively, for existing {\\it Chandra}, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\\sim10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\\sim10^{31}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\\sim10^{36}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20\\%, 8\\%, and 18\\% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$α$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.",

      "summary": "Open clusters serve as laboratories to study and evaluate stellar evolution and Galactic chemical evolution models. Chemical peculiarities, such as lithium-rich giants, are rarely observed in these stellar systems. This work focuses on eight red giants (#005, #028, #034, #053, #087, #121, #126, and #190) previously reported as members of the Galactic cluster IC 2714. We conducted a detailed investigation using high-resolution spectroscopy, supplemented with data from the Gaia DR3 catalog. Besides deriving the cluster's fundamental parameters, we provide the most thorough chemical characterization of IC 2714 to date, reporting the abundance of 23 species, including light elements (Li, C, N, O), odd-Z elements (Na, Al), $α$-elements (Si, Ca, Ti, Mg), iron-peak elements (Sc, Cr, Ni), $\\textit{s}$-process-dominated elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd) and $\\textit{r}$-process elements (Sm, Eu). We also present the carbon isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C for the first time for seven stars. One particular star (#087) exhibits a high lithium abundance ($\\log \\varepsilon$(Li)$_{\\rm NLTE}$ = $+$1.54 dex) and a slightly higher projected rotational velocity ($v \\sin i$ = 6.7 km s$^{-1}$). Our results suggest that the analyzed stars are in the core-helium-burning phase of evolution, where the most lithium-rich giants are found. Combining astrometric probabilities and chemical abundances, we conclude that two giants (#028 and #034) might not be cluster members.",

(2) The initial mass function from the most massive stars to substellar objects. (3) The role of the environment in the different modes of star formation from compact star clusters to born-this-way associations and from massive clusters to small stellar groups. More specifically, we present the contributions to such science that would be enabled by a 30~m type telescope in the northern hemisphere studying spiral galaxies. Those can be grouped in three: our own Galaxy, the Milky Way; the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group, M31 and M33; and other galaxies within 25 Mpc, such as M101, M51, and NGC~6946. This work is based on the fact that, as of today, no construction of a 30~m telescope has yet started in the northern hemisphere, so even in the best case scenario of such a hypothetical telescope, its full operation would not start until the late 2030s or early 2040s. It makes no assumptions about its location but supposes an instrumentation development similar to that of ELT.",

NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.",

      "summary": "Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between roughly $10^2\\,M_\\odot$ and $10^5\\,M_\\odot$, represent a largely uncharted component of the black-hole (BH) population. They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\\leq10\\,M_\\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\\simeq10^3-10^4 \\,M_\\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe.",

We show how the same capability also enables transformative science in active galactic nucleus (AGN) fuelling, stellar surfaces and interacting binaries, and exoplanet atmospheres. These science drivers are naturally aligned with a next-generation kilometre-scale optical/IR interferometer for the 2040s that reuses existing ESO infrastructure while adding diffraction-limited integral-field spectroscopy (IFS).",
