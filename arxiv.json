      "title": "Abundance anomalies in low mass field mergers as evidence of a merger\n  origin for the second generation stars in globular clusters",
      "summary": "  The canonical formation of second-generation (G2) stars in globular clusters\n(GCs) from gas enriched and ejected by G1 (primordial) polluters faces\nsubstantial challenges, i.e. (i) a mass-budget problem and (ii) uncertainty in\nthe source(s) of the abundance anomaly of light elements (AALE) in G2 stars.\nThe merger of G1 low-mass main-sequence (MS) binaries can overcome (i), but its\nability to result in AALE is omitted. We provide evidence of the merger process\nto explain AALE by relying on highly probable merger remnants in the Galactic\ndisk. We focus on carbon-deficient red-clump giants with low mass of 1.0\nM_{\\sun} < M $\\lesssim$ 2.0 M_{\\sun} and hot He-intermediate subdwarfs of\nsupersolar metallicity, both manifesting G2-like AALE incompatible with GC\norigin. The origin of such rare core He-burning stars as the mergers of [MS\nstar (MSS)]+[helium white dwarf (HeWD)] binaries, evolved from low-mass\nhigh-mass ratio (MSS+MSS) ones, is supported by models evolving to either\nhorizontal branch (HB) stars or He subdwarfs via the red giant branch (RGB).\nSuch binaries in the GC NGC 362 contain very young ($\\sim$ 4 Myr) extremely\nlow-mass HeWDs, in contrast to much older ($\\sim 100$ times) counterparts in\nopen clusters. This agrees with the impact of GC environment on the lifetime of\nhard binaries: (MSS+HeWD) systems merge there soon after arising from (MSS+MSS)\nbinaries that underwent the common-envelope stage of evolution. From the number\nand lifetime of the (MSS+HeWD) binaries uncovered in NGC 362, the expected\nfraction of their progeny RGB G2 stars is estimated to be $\\lesssim$10\\%. The\nfield merger remnants with G2-like AALE support the merger nature of at least a\nfraction of G2 stars in GCs. The specific channel [(MSS+MSS) - (MSS+HeWD) -\nmerger product] supported by observations and models is tentatively identified\nas the channel of formation of the extreme G2 RGB component in GCs.\n",

      "title": "Protostellar Jets in Star Cluster Formation and Evolution: I.\n  Implementation and Initial Results",
      "summary": "  Stars form in clusters from the gravitational collapse of giant molecular\nclouds, which is opposed by a variety of physical processes, including stellar\nfeedback. The interplay between these processes determines the star formation\nrate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a\nnumerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and\nevolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical\ncode FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical\nMultipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from\nionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until\nnow, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of\nprotostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free\nparameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation\nsimulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar\njets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \\times 10^4$\nM$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds\n(M $= 5 \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of\nprotostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and\ninjection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find\nthat the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the\ngas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch\nopens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster\nformation and evolution.\n",

      "title": "M&M33: MUSE and M33 I. Unveiling the Diversity of HII Regions in M33\n  with MUSE",
      "summary": "  We present new VLT/MUSE mosaic observations of a 3 $\\times$ 8 arcmin$^2$ area\nalong the southern major axis of the nearby galaxy M33 at a distance of 840 kpc\nfrom the Milky Way. These data provide an unprecedented view of the galaxy\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and allow us to resolve ionised nebulae at a spatial\nscale of $\\approx$5 pc. We identify and catalogue 124 HII regions, down to\nH$\\alpha$ luminosities of $\\approx 5\\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of\nmagnitude fainter than previous surveys on local galaxies, and compare these\nregions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star\nclusters. For each region, we extract the corresponding integrated optical\nspectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H$\\beta$,\n[OIII], [NII], H$\\alpha$, [SII], [SIII], other weaker optical lines when\ndetectable, and Paschen lines) to characterize their physical properties of the\nioinized gas such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially\nresolved line ratio and flux maps reveal remarkable diversity in ionisation\nproperties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly\nionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios (>5). Our data reveal a\ndiversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent.\nRadial profiles indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded)\nand optically thick (radiation-bounded) HII regions. Our study highlights the\nrichness of this MUSE mosaic and their unparalleled view of the ISM. In\nparticular, the ability to probe the ISM at $\\approx$ 5 pc resolution opens a\nnew window onto the complex structure of the ionised gas, enabling direct\ninsight into how stellar feedback operates on the scales where it originates.\n",

      "title": "Distance measurements from the internal dynamics of globular clusters:\n  Application to the Sombrero galaxy (M 104)",
      "summary": "  Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive\ngalaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between\ntheir internal stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling\naccurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity\ndispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594,\nthe Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions\nfor 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104\nusing high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with\nFLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions\nrange from $\\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of\n$\\Delta\\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band\nmagnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\\sigma > 4$ km\ns$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to\nM 104, finding $D=9.00\\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the\nMilky Way and M 31 $M_V-\\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the\nluminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than\nthe mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band\ndynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $<M/L_V> = 2.6 \\pm 0.8\nM_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V < -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is\nhigher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in\nCentaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD\nrelation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.\n",

      "summary": "  Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of ~5 kpc\nout to ~14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and\nbroadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar\nmetallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having\nsuper-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of ~160\nMyr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising\nthe central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for\na combined stellar mass (at birth) of ~4 $\\times$ 10$^9$ $\\rm M_\\odot$. A\nmultitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have\nbrightnesses comparable to the somewhat older (~500 Myr) super star clusters\n(SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively\nshallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially\nlarger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far)\nexceeding ~1 $\\times$ 10$^9$ $\\rm M_\\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light\n-- the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted\nstar clusters -- and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that,\nbeginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275,\nleaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the\nintracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were\ntidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy,\nwith the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.\n",

      "summary": "  The presence of nuclear discs in barred disc galaxies has been demonstrated\nin studies on stellar structures and kinematics. It is thus imperative to\nestablish their fundamental properties and scaling relations, which can help\nunderstanding their connection to other central stellar structures, including\nnuclear star clusters. In this Letter, we use results from the structural\nanalysis and star formation histories of a sample of galaxies with nuclear\ndiscs to show the distributions of fundamental parameters and scaling\nrelations. Our analysis shows that the nuclear disc mass-size relation, and the\nrelation between the nuclear disc mass and the stellar mass of its host galaxy,\nare - at face value - different from the corresponding relations for nuclear\nstar clusters, but marginally compatible given the uncertainties. This sets\nconstraints to scenarios in which their formation is connected. We also find\nthat the nuclear disc in the Milky Way is on the shorter end of the\ndistribution of sizes set by nuclear discs in other galaxies. This is the first\nanalysis of this kind for kinematically confirmed nuclear discs, and further\nunderstanding of the properties of the nuclear disc in the Milky Way and other\ngalaxies is necessary to corroborate these results.\n",

Their spatial proximity was assessed using photometric and\nastrometric data from \\textit{Gaia} DR3. Likely member stars were identified\nbased on a membership probability threshold ($P \\geq 0.5$), yielding 230\nmembers for Alessi 36 and 342 members for Collinder 135. The mean proper-motion\ncomponents ($\\mu_\\alpha \\cos\\delta, \\mu_\\delta$) were determined as $(-9.681\n\\pm 0.072, 7.021 \\pm 0.081)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Alessi 36 and $(-10.061 \\pm\n0.083, 6.256 \\pm 0.095)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Collinder 135. The parallax-based\ndistances ($d$) were found to be $278 \\pm 7$ and $299 \\pm 11$ pc, while their\nestimated ages ($t$) were $39 \\pm 5$ and $36 \\pm 5$ Myr for Alessi 36 and\nCollinder 135, respectively. The Galactic orbital analysis of Alessi 36 and\nCollinder 135 reveals nearly circular orbits with low eccentricities and minor\nfluctuations in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. The maximum\nheights they attain above the Galactic plane are $0.035 \\pm 0.001$ kpc for\nAlessi 36 and $0.074 \\pm 0.003$ kpc for Collinder 135, supporting their\nclassification as part of the young stellar disc population.\n",

      "summary": "  Stellar substructures within tidal debris preserve information about their\nprogenitor galaxies' properties, offering insights into hierarchical mass\nassembly. We examine a compact stellar system (CSS) around the nearby spiral\ngalaxy NGC 7531, including the shell-like tidal debris. Our goals are to\ndetermine the nature of the CSS, reconstruct the accretion history, and\nunderstand how the large, diffuse shell-like structure formed. We present\nphotometric measurements of the shell-like debris and CSS using DESI Legacy\nImaging Survey (LS) data. We obtained Keck/LRIS spectroscopic data for the CSS\nto confirm its association with NGC 7531 and to derive its star formation\nhistory (SFH). Deep ($\\sim$27.9 mag/arcsec$^{2}$) amateur telescope images\nenabled complete characterization of the tidal debris structure. We confirm the\nCSS is associated with NGC 7531. We rename it NGC 7531-UCD1, since its stellar\nmass ($3.7_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\\times 10^6$ $\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), half-light radius\n($R_{h} = 0.13 \\pm 0.05$ arcsec) and SFH place it as an ultra-compact dwarf\ngalaxy (UCD). NGC 7531-UCD1 was likely a nuclear star cluster (NSC) that was\ntidally stripped into a UCD- this is further supported by the presence of tidal\ntails. We quantify the shell-like debris' mass as $M_\\star\\sim 3$--$11\\times\n10^8 M_\\odot$, implying a merger mass ratio of ~300:1 to 10:1. Our amateur\ntelescope images confirm new pieces of debris, previously unclear in the DESI\nLS images. N-body simulations reproduce the tidal features, requiring a near\nradial orbit of the progenitor with two pericentric passages. The first passage\ncoincides with the measured star formation enhancement ~1 Gyr ago. Our findings\nagree with predictions about the NSC to UCD formation pathway via tidal\nstripping, and further confirm the presence of these objects outside of our\nMilky Way.\n",

      "title": "Chemical Abundances of M and G Dwarfs in the Hyades and Coma Berenices\n  Open Clusters from APOGEE Spectra",
      "summary": "  Open clusters are one of the best astrophysical laboratories we have\navailable for stellar astrophysics studies. This work presents metallicities\nand individual abundances for fourteen M dwarfs and six G dwarfs from two\nwell-known open clusters: Hyades and Coma Berenices. Our analysis is based on\nnear-infrared (1.51--1.69 $\\mu$m), high-resolution ($R \\sim 22,500$) spectra\nobtained from the SDSS IV/APOGEE Survey. Using one-dimensional, plane-parallel\nMARCS model atmospheres, the APOGEE line list, and the Turbospectrum radiative\ntransfer code in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derived spectroscopic\nstellar parameters for the M dwarfs, along with abundances of 13 elements (C,\nO, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for both M and G dwarfs. We\nfind a high degree of chemical homogeneity within each cluster when comparing\nabundances derived from M and G dwarfs: $\\delta$[M/H] (M dwarfs -- G dwarfs) of\n0.01$\\pm$0.04, and 0.02$\\pm$0.03 for the Hyades and Coma Berenices,\nrespectively. The overall cluster metallicities derived from M dwarfs (Hyades:\n0.16$\\pm$0.03 and Coma Berenices: 0.02$\\pm$0.06) are consistent with previous\nliterature determinations. Finally, we demonstrate the value of M dwarfs as key\ntracers in galactic archaeology, emphasizing their potential for studying\ngalactic metallicity gradients and chemical evolution.\n",
