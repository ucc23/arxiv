      "title": "The Small Magellanic Cloud through the lens of the James Webb Space\n  Telescope : binaries and mass function within the galaxy outskirts",
      "summary": "  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the fraction of binary systems\nare fundamental ingredients that govern the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies. Whether the IMF is universal or varies with environment remains one\nof the central open questions in astrophysics. Dwarf galaxies such as the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), with their low metallicity and diffuse star-forming\nregions, offer critical laboratories to address this issue. In this work, we\nexploit ultra-deep photometry from the James Webb Space Telescope to\ninvestigate the stellar populations in the field of the SMC. Using the $m_{\\rm\nF322W2}$ versus $m_{\\rm F115W}-m_{\\rm F322W2}$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD),\nwe derive the luminosity function and measure the fraction of unresolved binary\nsystems. We find a binary fraction of $f_{\\rm bin}^{q>0.6}=0.14\\pm0.01$,\nconsistent with results from synthetic CMDs incorporating the metallicity\ndistribution of the SMC. Additionally, the measured binary fraction in the SMC\nfield is consistent with those observed in Galactic open clusters and Milky Way\nfield stars of similar ages and masses, suggesting similar binary formation and\nevolutionary processes across these low-density environments. By combining the\nluminosity function with the best-fit isochrone, we derive the the mass\nfunction (MF) down to $0.22\\,M_{\\odot}$, the lowest mass limit reached for the\nSMC to date. The resulting MF follows a power-law with a slope of\n$\\alpha=-1.99\\pm0.08$. This value is shallower than the canonical Salpeter\nslope of $\\alpha=-2.35$, providing new evidence for IMF variations in\nlow-metallicity and low-density environments.\n",

      "title": "Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas\n  accretion",
      "summary": "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive\nproto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high\nredshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the\nmass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life\nof a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels\nthe primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment\nstellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the\ncluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for\nsufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar\nprogenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We\nestimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF),\nwith a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\\rm M}_\\odot$, gets shifted to values within\nthe upper BH mass gap, $\\sim 60-130{\\rm M}_\\odot$, or higher, as observed by\nGravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are\nshifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap,\nwell within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123,\ndepending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and\ncompactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a\nsurprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent\nin the range $\\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that\nare sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\\sim\n10^6{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and size $\\sim 1{\\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that\nproto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have\ngenerated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\\sim 10^2-10^3{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$.\n",

      "title": "The heart of NGC 5253 as seen with MUSE-NFM: nitrogen enrichment through\n  stellar chemical feedback at parsec scales",
      "summary": "  NGC 5253 is a nearby (D=3.6 Mpc) Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy, notable for its\nthree massive young super star clusters (SSCs) and nitrogen enrichment. Its\nsimilarity to extreme star-forming galaxies at high redshift makes it a good\nlocal analogue for studying chemical enrichment at high spatial resolution. We\ncharacterise the ionised gas and dust in the giant HII region in the proximity\nof the three SSCs in the centre of NGC 5253 using new Multi-Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer Narrow Field Mode adaptive optics-assisted data at unprecedented\nspatial resolution of 0.\"15$\\sim$2.3 pc. We derive the attenuation for the\ncentral SSCs and, for the first time, map the extinction parameter ($R_V$) in\nan extragalactic object. $R_V$ varies among SSCs, suggesting differences in\ndust physics. Electron temperature and density diagnostics yield flat\ntemperature distributions $T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([NII])$=12000 \\pm 1700$ K and\n$T_\\mathrm{e,median}$([SIII])$ = 11000 \\pm 600$ K, and a structured\n$n_e$([SII]) of maximum $1930 \\pm 40$ cm$^{-3}$. The direct method gives a flat\nhelium abundance ($10^3y^+ = 81 \\pm 4$) and uniform oxygen abundance ($12 +\n\\log(\\text{O/H}) = 8.22 \\pm 0.05$). N/O shows a factor 2-3 enhancement around\nthe SSCs, mapped here for the first time at such high spatial resolution. The\ntotal excess nitrogen mass is $\\sim$0.3 $M_\\odot$, which we estimate is\nproducible by the observed WN-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Because there is no\ndirect spatial overlap between the enrichment and WR star positions, the N-rich\nmaterial appears to have been expelled from the original sites.\n",

      "title": "Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical\ninteractions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense\nenvironments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their\ntidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs),\ntransient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a\nsuite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we\nimplemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of\nrealistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky\nWay population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution,\nsupernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the\nGalactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical\nchannels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters,\nbinary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and\ninteractions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical\ntriples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple\nencounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total\nrate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be\ndetectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The\ngravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz\nband, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar\nGravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave\nObservatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources,\npotentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar\ncollisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both\nelectromagnetic and GW observations.\n",

      "title": "Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly\n  Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters",
      "summary": "  GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by\nLIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive,\nhigh-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural\nenvironments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive\nstar evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs\nthrough dynamical interactions (the so-called \"hierarchical merger\" channel),\nmost star clusters with masses $\\lesssim 10^6\\,M_\\odot$ have escape speeds too\nlow to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass\ngap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the\ncollision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape\nspeed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and\nspin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH\nmasses up to at least $\\sim200\\,M_\\odot$, with spins set by the details of the\ngrowth history. BHs up to about $150\\,M_\\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins\n$\\chi \\gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form\nthrough multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\\chi\n\\lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters,\nproducing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\\sim10\\%$ of all detectable\nevents, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the\ntwo pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more\nunequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form\nnear-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters\nwith low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning\nBBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural\nformation pathway to GW231123-like systems.\n",

      "summary": "  To date, quantification of the on-sky motion for interstellar clouds have\nrelied on proxies such as young stellar objects (YSO) and masers. We present\nthe first direct measurement of an interstellar cloud proper motion using the\nVISTA Star Formation Atlas (VISIONS) multi-epoch infrared images of the Corona\nAustralis star-forming region. Proper motions are extracted by tracking the\nmorphology of extended structures in the cloud complex based on image\nregistration techniques implemented in SimpleITK. Our determined values\n($\\mu_{\\alpha^*} \\sim +15$ mas/yr, $\\mu_{\\delta} \\sim -30$ mas/yr) are in good\nagreement with those obtained for YSOs and young stellar clusters in the\nregion. This study demonstrates the potential of image registration for\ndirectly mapping the kinematics of nearby molecular clouds, opening a new\nwindow into the study of cloud dynamics.\n",

      "title": "Resolving Emission from Small Dust Grains in the Blue Compact Dwarf II\n  Zw 40 with JWST",
      "summary": "  We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Spectrograph\n(NIRSpec) and Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral-field spectroscopy of the\nnearby blue compact dwarf II Zw 40, which has a low metallicity of 25% of\nsolar. Leveraging the high spatial/spectral resolution and wavelength coverage\nof JWST/NIRSpec, we present robust detections of the 3.3 um polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission on 20 pc scales. The strength of the Pf delta\nemission relative to the 3.3 PAH feature is significantly stronger than typical\nhigher metallicity star-forming galaxies. We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is\nconcentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO\ngas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation\nhardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH\nmolecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the\noverall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies,\nthe contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher.\nWe propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two\ncompeting mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and\ninhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40\nsuggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one\nof the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a\nlow-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance\nfor future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies\nusing JWST.\n",

      "title": "Nuclear Stellar Discs",
      "summary": "  We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs),\nrotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both\nearly- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics,\nstellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We\nderive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and\ncompare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The\nrelationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including\nnuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role\nof NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted,\nemphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such\nas their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves\nas a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve\nindividual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics,\ndynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of\na nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue\nthat NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven\ngas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas\nduring a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions,\nfuture research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming\nobservational facilities.\n",

      "title": "Rubin Data Preview 1: Extending the View of Unresolved Binary Stars in\n  47 Tucanae",
      "summary": "  Until now, the study of unresolved main sequence binary stars in globular\nclusters has been possible almost exclusively in their central regions with\ndeep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We present the first detection\nof unresolved main-sequence binary stars in the outer field of 47 Tucanae using\nRubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1). Our analysis exploits deep $i$ vs.\n$g-i$ colour-magnitude diagrams beyond the cluster's half-light radius,\nreaching almost to the tidal radius. The high-quality photometry allowed to\nidentify unresolved binaries with mass ratios $q$ larger than 0.7. The derived\nbinary fraction of $f_\\mathrm{bin}(q>0.7) = 0.016 \\pm 0.005$ stands in contrast\nto the significantly lower values in the cluster innermost regions, as measured\nfrom HST photometry. This result provides new empirical input for testing\nphysical processes that drive the formation and evolution of binary stars in\nglobular clusters. It also demonstrates Rubin's unique wide-field and\nhigh-precision photometric capabilities to address a broader range of\noutstanding questions in star cluster research. Future full data releases will\nenable to significantly expand the study of dense stellar systems across the\nMilky Way.\n",
