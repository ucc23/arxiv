      "title": "SIGNALS of Giant HII Regions: A Spatially Resolved Analysis of NGC 604",
      "summary": "  Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed\nstructures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical\nproperties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission\nline data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized\nGas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the\nprincipal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII\nregion in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\\alpha$ morphology and\nare clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and\nsecondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show\nsubstantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these\nvariations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily\ncaused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios.\nWe present the H$\\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the\nexcitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial\ndistribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these\nexcitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary\nnebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the\noverall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution\nspatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns\nabout single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII\nregions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such\nmethods.\n",

      "title": "Foreground Extinction to Extended Celestial Objects -- I. New Extinction\n  Maps",
      "summary": "  We present a new two-dimensional (2D) map of total Galactic extinction,\n$A_\\mathrm{V}$, across the entire dust half-layer from the Sun to extragalactic\nspace for Galactic latitudes $|b|>13$ deg, as well as a three-dimensional (3D)\nmap of $A_\\mathrm{V}$ within 2~kpc of the Sun. These maps are based on\n$A_\\mathrm{V}$ and distance estimates derived from a dataset, which utilizes\n{\\it Gaia} Data Release 3 parallaxes and multi-band photometry for nearly 100\nmillion dwarf stars. We apply our own corrections to account for significant\nsystematics in this dataset. Our 2D map achieves an angular resolution of\n6.1~arcmin, while the 3D map offers a transverse resolution of 3.56~pc --\ncorresponding to variable angular resolution depending on distance -- and a\nradial resolution of 50~pc. In constructing these maps, we pay particular\nattention to the solar neighborhood (within 200~pc) and to high Galactic\nlatitudes. The 3D map predicts $A_\\mathrm{V}$ from the Sun to any extended\nobject within the Galactic dust layer with an accuracy of $\\sigma(A_\\mathrm{V})\n= 0.1$~mag. The 2D map provides $A_\\mathrm{V}$ estimates for the entire dust\nhalf-layer up to extragalactic distances with an accuracy of\n$\\sigma(A_\\mathrm{V}) = 0.07$~mag. We provide $A_\\mathrm{V}$ estimates from our\nmaps for various classes of extended celestial objects with angular size\nprimarily in the range of 2--40~arcmin, including 19,809 galaxies and quasars,\n170 Galactic globular clusters, 458 open clusters, and several hundreds\nmolecular clouds from two lists. We also present extinction values for 8,293\nType Ia supernovae. Comparison of our extinction estimates with those from\nprevious maps and literature sources reveals systematic differences, indicating\nlarge-scale spatial variations in the extinction law and suggesting that\nearlier 2D reddening maps based on infrared dust emission tend to underestimate\nlow extinction values.\n",

      "title": "Unveiling Dynamics and Variability in Open Clusters: Insights from a\n  Comprehensive Analysis of Six Galactic Clusters",
      "summary": "  We present a kinematic and dynamical analysis of six Galactic open clusters\nNGC~2204, NGC~2660, NGC~2262, Czernik~32, Pismis~18, and NGC~2437, using\n\\textit{Gaia}~DR3. We used Bayesian and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) methods to\nidentify cluster members, but chose GMM because it's more appropriate for\nlow-mass stars. Estimated distances range from 1.76 to 4.20~kpc and ages from\n0.199 to 1.95~Gyr, confirming their intermediate-age nature. King model fits\nindicate compact morphologies, with core radii of 1--10~arcmin and cluster\nradii of 5--24~arcmin. We identify 13 BSS and 3 YSS members, whose central\nconcentrations suggest origins via mass transfer or stellar collisions. The\nmass function slopes (0.96--1.19) are flatter than the Salpeter value, which\nindicates that these clusters have undergone dynamical mass segregation. Orbit\nintegration within a Galactic potential indicates nearly circular orbits\n(eccentricities 0.02--0.10), vertical excursions within $\\pm$132~pc, and\nguiding radii near the solar circle, suggesting disk confinement. These\nclusters likely formed in the thin disk and are shaped by Galactic tidal\nperturbations, facilitating the rapid loss of low-mass members. Additionally,\ntwelve variable stars were found across four clusters using \\textit{TESS} light\ncurves, including $\\gamma$~Doradus and SPB pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and a\nyellow straggler candidate. Periods were derived via Lomb-Scargle analysis. Two\neclipsing binaries (TIC~94229743 and TIC~318170024) were modeled using PHOEBE,\nyielding mass ratios of 1.37 and 2.16, respectively. Our findings demonstrate\nthat integrating orbital dynamics and variable star studies presents valuable\ninsights into the evolutionary pathways of open clusters.\n",

      "summary": "  The extremely-low-luminosity, compact Milky Way satellite Ursa Major III /\nUNIONS 1 (UMaIII/U1; $L_V = 11 \\ L_{\\odot}$; $a_{1/2} = 3$ pc) was found to\nhave a substantial velocity dispersion at the time of its discovery ($\\sigma_v\n= 3.7^{+1.4}_{-1.0} \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$), suggesting that it might be an\nexceptional, highly dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy with very few stars.\nHowever, significant questions remained about the system's dark matter content\nand nature as a dwarf galaxy due to the small member sample ($N=11$), possible\nspectroscopic binaries, and the lack of any metallicity information. Here, we\npresent new spectroscopic observations covering $N=16$ members that both\ndynamically and chemically test UMaIII/U1's true nature. From higher-precision\nKeck/DEIMOS spectra, we find a 95% confidence level velocity dispersion limit\nof $\\sigma_v< 2.3 \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$, with a $\\sim$120:1 likelihood ratio now\nfavoring the expected stellar-only dispersion of $\\sigma_* \\approx 0.1 \\rm \\ km\n\\ s^{-1}$ over the original $3.7 \\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1}$ dispersion. There is now no\nobservational evidence for dark matter in the system. From Keck/LRIS spectra\ntargeting the Calcium II K line, we also measure the first metallicities for 12\nmember stars, finding a mean metallicity of $\\rm [Fe/H] = -2.65 \\; \\pm \\, 0.1$\n(stat.) $\\pm \\,0.3$ (zeropoint) with a metallicity dispersion limit of\n$\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} < 0.35$ dex (at the 95% credible level). Together, these\nproperties are more consistent with UMaIII/U1 being a star cluster, though the\ndwarf galaxy scenario is not fully ruled out. Under this interpretation,\nUMaIII/U1 ranks among the most metal-poor star clusters yet discovered and is\npotentially the first known example of a cluster stabilized by a substantial\npopulation of unseen stellar remnants.\n",

      "summary": "  Kinematic studies of young stars and star clusters have increased our\nunderstanding of the process of star formation and evolution in the Milky Way.\nFU Orionis objects are a specific class of young stellar object notable for\ntheir extremely high disk-to-star accretion rates. We use parallax and proper\nmotion information from the Gaia astrometric survey to study five known FU Ori\nstars towards the Cygnus clouds, in the distance range ~500-900 parsecs, and\nseek evidence of their kinematic association with proximal stellar groups or\nclusters. We develop multiple search criteria within the Gaia datasets to look\nfor nearby stellar aggregates and to reliably isolate their likely member\nstars. We show that V1057 Cygni and HBC 722 are kinematically consistent with\nthe 3D locations as well as the inferred proper motion fields of the North\nAmerica Nebula cluster. We show a similar association of V1515 Cygni with NGC\n6914 in the Cygnus-X region, and of V2494 Cygni with stars in the dark cloud\nLDN 1003 and Braid Nebula. Further, we find that V1735 Cygni is consistent in\nboth position and proper motion with the streamer structure of IC 5146, and we\ntrace the streamer's similar proper motions to the main cluster.\nColor-magnitude diagrams of all identified clusters show the presence of\npre-main-sequence populations, strengthening the likelihood of a physical\nassociation between the young FU Ori stars and their respective nearby\nclusters.\n",

      "title": "Black hole dragging: a new mechanism for forming nuclear star clusters\n  in giant elliptical galaxies",
      "summary": "  It has long been thought that nuclear star clusters (NSCs) cannot co-exist\nwith the most massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs), since SMBH mergers -\nunavoidable for the most massive systems - would scatter away NSC stars.\nHowever, central concentrations of light have now been reported in up to a\nthird of all massive ellipticals. We present a new mechanism for forming NSCs\nin giant elliptical galaxies, arising naturally from SMBH mergers, which could\nexplain these observations. We call this ''black hole dragging''. After a major\nmerger of two galaxies and their SMBHs, the newly-merged SMBH can receive a\ngravitational wave recoil kick. We show that recoiling SMBHs induce two\ncompeting effects on the galaxy's background stars. Firstly, some stars become\nbound to the SMBH and co-move with it, an effect strongest at low recoil\nvelocities. Secondly, background stars are ejected as the recoiling SMBH falls\nback due to dynamical friction, an effect strongest at high recoil velocities.\nAt intermediate recoil velocities (500-1000 km/s), both effects become\nimportant, and the density of bound stars can exceed that of the background\nstellar core. This yields a central dense NSC that is clearly visible in the\ngalaxy's surface brightness profile. We show that NSCs formed in this way have\nrealistic sizes, masses and velocity dispersions when measured similarly to\nobserved systems. This provides a route for even giant ellipticals containing\nSMBHs to host an NSC. We predict such NSCs should have indistinguishable\ncolors, ages and chemistry from non-NSC central stars, combined with low\nellipticities.\n",

      "title": "Dynamical model of Praesepe and its tidal tails",
      "summary": "  Context. The dynamical evolution of open clusters in the tidal field of the\nMilky Way and the feeding of the disc field star population depend strongly on\nthe initial conditions at the time of gas removal. Detailed dynamical models\ntailored to individual clusters help us understand the role of open clusters in\nthe Galactic disc evolution. Aims. We present a detailed dynamical model of\nPraesepe, which reproduces the mass profile, the stellar mass function, and the\nmass segregation observed with the help of Gaia EDR3 data. Based on this model,\nwe investigate the kinematic properties of the tidal tail stars in detail.\nMethods. We used direct N-body simulations along the eccentric orbit of\nPraesepe in the tidal field of the Milky Way, where each particle represents\none star. The initial mass and size of the cluster, the dynamical state, and\nthe initial mass function were adapted to reach the best-fitting model. Based\non this model and a comparison model on a circular orbit, we analysed the stars\nin the tidal tails in terms of density, angular momentum, and orbit shapes.\nResults. Praesepe can be well reproduced by a cluster model with concentrated\nstar formation in a supervirial state after instantaneous gas expulsion,\nadopting a global star formation efficiency of 17%. About 75% of the initially\n7500 MSol are lost in the violent relaxation phase, and the observed mass\nsegregation can be understood by two-body relaxation. We find that the\nself-gravity of the tail stars is the dominant force altering the angular\nmomentum of the tail stars. For a typical star, the total change after escaping\nis about 1.6 kpc km/s. This corresponds to an offset in guiding radius of 7 pc,\nwhere tail stars contribute up to 70% to the alteration. The total radial shift\nof the orbit of the cluster in the Galactic plane can exceed 50 pc. This effect\nis not a result of the eccentricity of the orbit.\n",
